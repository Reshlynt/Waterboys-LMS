Course Introduction and Welcome:\n 
Welcome to Introduction to Python course!\n
In this course, we will learn the basics of Python programming language and how to use it to solve various problems.\n
Throughout the course, we will cover topics such as data types, variables, operators, control structures, functions, file input/output, object-oriented programming, and working with libraries and modules.\n
We will also explore more advanced topics such as working with APIs, web scraping, and automation. By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of Python programming language and the skills to apply it to real-world projects.\n

A variable is like a container for information: it stores values of different types depending on the use case.
Variables are really important in programming because this storage of data allows use later in the program.


Type conversion, also known as casting, refers to the process of converting one data type to another.\nIn Python, you can convert between primitive data types using built-in functions such as int(), float(), str(), and bool().\nFor example, you can use int() to convert a string containing a number to an integer, or float() to convert an integer or string to a floating-point number.\nSimilarly, you can use str() to convert a number to a string, or bool() to convert a value to either True or False.\nIt's important to note that some conversions may result in a loss of precision or information, so it's always best to use the appropriate conversion function for the desired result.

"# Converting a string to an integer:\nage_str = '27'\nage_int = int(age_str)\nprint(age_int)  # Output: 27\n\n# Converting a float to an integer:\nprice_float = 9.99\nprice_int = int(price_float)\nprint(price_int)  # Output: 9\n\n# Converting an integer to a string:\ncount_int = 10\ncount_str = str(count_int)\nprint(count_str)  # Output: "10"\n\n# Converting a boolean to an integer:\nis_true = True\nis_false = False\nint_true = int(is_true)\nint_false = int(is_false)\nprint(int_true)   # Output: 1\nprint(int_false)  # Output: 0\n\n# Converting a string to a boolean:\nis_true_str = "True"\nis_false_str = "False"\nbool_true = bool(is_true_str)\nbool_false = bool(is_false_str)\nprint(bool_true)   # Output: True\nprint(bool_false)  # Output: True (any non-empty string is considered True)
